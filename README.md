# Who this is for

This is for course instructors who want to use Markdown + YAML for all course materials and publish those materials (for free!) to a simple course website (using GitHub Pages).

# Example Course

[Include link to example]

# Setup

If you would like to use this for one of your courses, fork this project, update the README.md file, and start building out your course using the boilerplate files as a reference. If you run into any trouble, first check GitHub's instructions for publishing this repository with GitHub Pages.
